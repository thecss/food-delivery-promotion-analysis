## 💼 Business Problem
FoodHub is an online food delivery platform that connects customers with restaurants across New York City.

To maximize the impact of in-app promotions, the Growth team wants to identify restaurants and cuisines that consistently demonstrate strong customer demand and positive customer experiences. However, with a growing number of restaurant partners and customer orders, it is difficult to determine which restaurants should be prioritized for promotional campaigns.

Without data-driven insights, promotional efforts may target the wrong restaurants, reducing campaign effectiveness and missing opportunities to improve customer engagement, satisfaction, and revenue.

<br>

## 🎯 Objective
As a Data Analyst on the Growth Analytics team, I was tasked with analyzing FoodHub's order data to identify high-performing restaurants and cuisines, understand customer demand, and generate actionable insights to support data-driven in-app promotion decisions.

<br>

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses the **FoodHub Orders** dataset, containing customer food delivery orders placed through an online food delivery platform in New York City.

**Key attributes:** Restaurant Name, Cuisine Type, Order Cost, Day of the Week, Customer Rating, Food Preparation Time, and Delivery Time.

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. ### 🍽️ Restaurant Performance Analysis
    *  **Shake Shack (219 orders), The Meatball Shop (132 orders), and Blue Ribbon Sushi (119 orders)** consistently attracted the highest customer demand while maintaining strong average ratings (4.22–4.51) and average order values of approximately $16.
    *  **Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill, Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Sushi of Gari Tribeca** achieved customer ratings of 4.5+ despite moderate order volumes(24–44 orders), indicating strong potential for targeted promotional campaigns.
    *  Fulfillment times were consistent across restaurants, ranging from approximately 47 to 54 minutes. No significant operational differences were observed among restaurants with more than 10 orders.<br>
      
<br>

2. ### 🍣 Cuisine Performance Analysis
   * **American, Japanese, and Italian** cuisines were the most popular choices among customers, receiving 584, 470, and 298 orders respectively. These cuisines also maintained strong customer ratings (4.30–4.37⭐) with an average order value of around $16.
   * Some cuisines had strong customer satisfaction but lower demand. For example, **Indian (4.54⭐), Thai (4.67⭐), and Spanish (4.83⭐)** cuisines received excellent ratings but had moderate orders(12–73 orders), showing potential opportunities to increase customer awareness.
   * Customer preferences were similar across weekdays and weekends. **American, Japanese, and Italian** cuisines remained the top three choices on both days, suggesting consistent demand throughout the week.

## ✅ Recommendations
  1. Feature high-performing restaurants(such as Shake Shack, The Meatball Shop, and Blue Ribbon Sushi) in promotional placements to maximize customer engagement and order volume.
  2. Increase visibility for highly rated restaurants with moderate demand(such as Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill, Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Sushi of Gari Tribeca) to encourage customer discovery and support growth opportunities.
  3. Prioritize popular cuisine categories (American, Japanese, and Italian) in platform-wide promotions, as they consistently drive the highest customer demand.
  4. Promote targeted campaigns for highly rated cuisines (such as Indian, Thai, and Spanish) to increase awareness and expand their customer base.
  5. Maintain a consistent cuisine promotion strategy throughout the week, as customer preferences remain largely stable across weekdays and weekends.
